### Hi there - I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer / Consultant @Objektkultur

:high_brightness: During the day I mostly use the power of Azure to satisfy customer needs

:full_moon_with_face: By night I jump over to Firebase to kickstart some of my private projects. Those are, whenever possible written in TypeScript and make use of serverless computing

:school: I also teach software development @Hochschule Karlsruhe, to show off some of the cool stuff one can do with the right tools at their hands

:rocket: Some of my most recent projects, which are solely hosted on Firebase, are
- *in development* learn2Code@HsKA: A learning platform for students - by students. Build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), automated via of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and powerd by [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
- [A COVID-19 dashboard](https://rkicasesapi.web.app/): tracks the spread of the disease in germany on a state and county level. The poor experience, especially on mobile devices, by the [official dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4) inspired me to develop something on my own.
- [Recipe Handler 4.0](https://recipehandler.web.app/): A Progressive Web App to collect, categorise and share recipes. The project serves as playground for upcoming, exciting web standards. So don't expect it to work in IE11 :scream:. This can easily be deployed to a new Firebase project. If you need help with that feel free to contact me

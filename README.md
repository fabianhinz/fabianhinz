### Hi there - I'm a passionate Fullstack Engineer

:high_brightness: During the day I mostly use the Google Cloud Platform

:full_moon_with_face: By night I jump over to Firebase to kickstart some of my private projects. Those are, whenever possible written in TypeScript and make use of serverless computing

:school: I also teach software development @Hochschule Karlsruhe, to show off some of the cool stuff one can do with the right tools at their hands

:rocket: Some of my most recent projects, which are solely hosted on Firebase, are
- [Recipe Handler 4.0](https://recipehandler.web.app/): A Progressive Web App to collect, categorise and share recipes ([repo](https://github.com/fabianhinz/RecipeHandler-4.0))
- ***archived*** - [COVID-19 dashboard](https://rkicasesapi.web.app/): tracks the spread of the disease in germany on a state and county level ([repo](https://github.com/fabianhinz/rkicasesdashboard))
- ***archived*** - [learn2Code@HsKA](https://learn2code-hska.web.app/): A learning platform for students - by students ([repo](https://github.com/fabianhinz/learnToCode))
